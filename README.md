# Hive_Sentiment-Text-Analysis_NGram
Analyze business data files using Hive text processing to see user sentiment and analyze customer comments and product ratings. 


# Background
Customer ratings and feedback are great sources of information for both customers and retailers. However, customer comments are typically free-form text and must be handled differently. Hive provides extensive support for text processing.

# Analyize Numeric Product Ratings
Before text processing, analyze the numeric ratings customers have assigned to various products.

# Analyze Rating Comments
Although numeric ratings on product reviews can help identify a specific products that has issues, we may not understand why customers don’t like the product. We could simply read through all the comments associated with that product to learn this information, but that approach doesn’t scale. 
So, we will use Hive’s text processing support to analyze the comments.
