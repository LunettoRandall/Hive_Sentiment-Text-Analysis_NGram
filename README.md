# Hive_Sentiment-Text-Analysis_NGram
Analyze business data files using Hive text processing to see user sentiment and analyze customer comments and product ratings. 

# Before text processing, analyze the numeric ratings customers have assigned to various products.

# Analyze Rating Comments
# Although numeric ratings can help identify issues, we may not understand why customers don’t like the product. We could simply read through all the comments associated with that product to learn this information, but that approach doesn’t scale. So, we will use Hive’s text processing support to analyze the comments.
